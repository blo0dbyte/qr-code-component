# Overview
This challenge was relatively easy. I'm still very new to using Git and Github. I find that the Github interface can be somewhat intimidating and confusing, but I'm glad to have the practice.

# What I learned

When it comes to CSS, I struggle most with positioning elements. This challenge was a quick and simple way to practice the skill. As I am still very new to Github and the general concept of repositories, I also gained a very general understanding of how these work. 

# Continued development

Moving forward, I will be refining my CSS skills until I no longer have to think at great length about how to solve an issue in my code. I will also be familiarising myself with Github as I continue to take on more challenges.
